===============================================
 Percona :program:`apt` Repository
===============================================

*Debian* and *Ubuntu* packages from *Percona* are signed with a key. Before using the repository, you should add the key to :program:`apt`. To do that, run the following commands: ::

  $ apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A

Add this to :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` (or create a dedicated Percona repository file :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/percona.list`), and replace ``VERSION`` with the name of your distribution: ::

  deb http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main 
  deb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main

Remember to update the local cache: ::

  $ apt-get update

Supported Architectures
=======================

 * x86_64 (also known as amd64)
 * x86

Install XtraDB Cluster
=======================

Following command will install Cluster packages: :: 

$ sudo apt-get install percona-xtradb-cluster-55

.. note:: 

  For Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) and 14.10 (Utopic) ``percona-xtradb-cluster-galera-2.x`` will have to be specified with the meta package so the installation command should look like: :: 

  $ sudo apt-get install percona-xtradb-cluster-55 percona-xtradb-cluster-galera-2.x

Instead of ``percona-xtradb-cluster-55`` you can install ``percona-xtradb-cluster-full-55`` meta-package which will install ``percona-xtradb-cluster-test-5.5``, ``percona-xtradb-cluster-5.5-dbg``, ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd-2.x``, ``percona-xtradb-cluster-galera-2x-dbg``, ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd-2.x-dbg`` and ``libmysqlclient18`` packages in addition.

.. note:: 
    
   Garbd is packaged separately as part of debian split packaging. The garbd debian package is ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd-2.x``. The package contains, garbd, daemon init script and related config files. This package will be installed if you install the ``percona-xtradb-cluster-full-55`` meta package.

Percona `apt` Testing repository
================================

Percona offers fresh beta builds from the experimental repository. To enable it add the following lines to your  :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` , replacing ``VERSION`` with the name of your distribution: ::

  deb http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main testing
  deb-src http://repo.percona.com/apt VERSION main testing

Apt-Pinning the packages
========================

In some cases you might need to "pin" the selected packages to avoid the upgrades from the distribution repositories. You'll need to make a new file :file:`/etc/apt/preferences.d/00percona.pref` and add the following lines in it: :: 

  Package: *
  Pin: release o=Percona Development Team
  Pin-Priority: 1001

For more information about the pinning you can check the official `debian wiki <http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences>`_.
